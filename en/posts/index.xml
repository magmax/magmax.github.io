instance locally, using <a href="https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Kind</a> to create the
Kubernetes cluster.
In addition, I will use cert-manager to create a self-signed certificate to
serve it with HTTPS.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Nowadays,
<abbr title="Service Oriented Architectures">SOA</abbr>

architectures is in fashion. These architectures use little and very specific services, so they interact each other.</p>
<p>In this post I&rsquo;ll show how to use <a href="https://www.celeryproject.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Celery</a> in order to create a SOA architecture.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>In this article I will talk about what Engineering means to me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to ask any reader that, before reading this article, use a couple of minutes to answer the question: <em>&ldquo;What does &lsquo;to be an Engineer&rsquo; mean?&quot;</em>. After this small exercise, I suggest to write a short answer down in a piece of paper.</p>
<p>After doing that, you can read the article. If it likes you or not, compare my answer with yours. Finally, try to define it again and, if you want, share your definition as a comment.</p>
<p>I hope you like this post. I hope it to make you to think.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m following the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/softwaresec" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Software Security</a> course at <a href="https://www.coursera.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Coursera</a>.</p>
<p>In this course, they explain how an adversary can take advantage of code defects and how to defend from them. I&rsquo;ve looking for some like this for long time.</p>
<p>At the end of one of the videos there is a kind of poetry I liked. But I didn&rsquo;t found it in Internet. So I&rsquo;ve copied it here. It gathers all kind of code defects we should avoid because an adversary can try to use them.</p>
<p>So here you are: &ldquo;Gashlycode Tinies&rdquo; by <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/andru/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Andrew Myers</a>, inspired by the &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gashlycrumb_Tinies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Gashlycrumb Tinies</a>&rdquo; (1963) by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Gorey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Edward Gorey</a></p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Some days ago I browsed a Kinisoftware slideshow and he said that &ldquo;Java rules&rdquo;. He couldn&rsquo;t explain why Java rules at the end, so I decided to do it in his place.</p>
<p>But at the end I will explain why <em>Java <em>does not</em> rule</em>.</p>
<p>I hope that Kinisoftware can read this and criticate it with all his soul. Kini: This is for you!</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>This week I realized about the difference between an ugly constructor and a pretty one. It is curious how easy doing it well is and how cheap it is, so I am going to share my point with you, waiting your comments.</p>
<p>Since I began to work, I have done lots of ugly things, so do not face me up if you find something mine done in a different way :D The real goal is to improve yourself day after day!</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Today I have discovered lots of things about this great unknown <em>assert</em>.</p>
<p>It happens that I had a very strong debugging tool too close from myself and I hadn&rsquo;t used it.</p>
<p>Trying to fix this problem, I write this article, but I am not going to write
anything that is not already written at <a href="https://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/language/assert.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Java Assert Documentation</a>  or <a href="https://docs.python.org/release/2.5.2/ref/assert.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Python

    <title>XML vs JSON (en)</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Lately I am seeing lots of comparatives between JSON and XML. I do not want to be less than them, so I investigated a little to enter in this kind of comparatives.</p>
<p>Sadly, I realized that they are not comparable. To compare XML with JSON is just like compare an OpenOffice document with a text file. They are completely different things.</p>
<p>A JSON file is a set of grouped data. Nothing more. It allows a hierarchical structure, but you only have objects, vectors, vars and values.</p>
<p>An XML file is lots of things more. It is a set of structured data. It can be queried (xpath), checks (DTD, XML Schema), viaualization (CSS), process (XSL), etc.</p>
<p>But lots of people continue on comparing them. Let&rsquo;s see their arguments:</p>
