    <description><![CDATA[<p>In this article I will talk about what Engineering means to me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to ask any reader that, before reading this article, use a couple of minutes to answer the question: <em>&ldquo;What does &rsquo;to be an Engineer&rsquo; mean?&rdquo;</em>. After this small exercise, I suggest to write a short answer down in a piece of paper.</p>
<p>After doing that, you can read the article. If it likes you or not, compare my answer with yours. Finally, try to define it again and, if you want, share your definition as a comment.</p>
<p>I hope you like this post. I hope it to make you to think.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>This week I realized about the difference between an ugly constructor and a pretty one. It is curious how easy doing it well is and how cheap it is, so I am going to share my point with you, waiting your comments.</p>
<p>Since I began to work, I have done lots of ugly things, so do not face me up if you find something mine done in a different way :D The real goal is to improve yourself day after day!</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Today I have discovered lots of things about this great unknown <em>assert</em>.</p>
<p>It happens that I had a very strong debugging tool too close from myself and I hadn&rsquo;t used it.</p>
<p>Trying to fix this problem, I write this article, but I am not going to write
anything that is not already written at <a href="https://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/language/assert.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Java Assert Documentation</a>  or <a href="https://docs.python.org/release/2.5.2/ref/assert.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Python
Documentation</a>.</p>]]></description>
