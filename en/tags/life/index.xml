      <description>I hate listenig things like &amp;ldquo;Madrid is much better than my town, because they organize a lot of things&amp;rdquo;.
This is a complete conceptual error. The problem is not that few things were organized in your town; the problem is that you are not organizing them.
  It is too easy complaining about other people who does nothing, but the first step is to focus on the things you do.</description>
