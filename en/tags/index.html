  Pressing the tab key in bash to auto-complete a file name is one of the most time saving tricks especially when dealing with very long file names. Unfortunately, file name completion is not always the right behavior. Take Subversion for example. The first argument to svn is the sub-command to use.

  No one likes to sit at home and wait for their favorite show to come on anymore and many have turned to buying hardware to record them for later viewing. Popular solutions to this problem include the expensive and proprietary TiVo and cable/satellite boxes with built-in TV recorders.

  There are many command-line utilities in the Unix / Linux world that collect network traffic statistics for a chosen interface.
vnstat is different because statistics are collected permanently. It keeps the data in files so traffic monitoring is resumed at reboot. vnstat can be useful in situations when you need to know the exact amount of traffic that goes through the interface for a period longer than the computer is on.

      In this article I will talk about what Engineering means to me.
I&rsquo;d like to ask any reader that, before reading this article, use a couple of minutes to answer the question: &ldquo;What does &lsquo;to be an Engineer&rsquo; mean?&quot;. After this small exercise, I suggest to write a short answer down in a piece of paper.
After doing that, you can read the article. If it likes you or not, compare my answer with yours.

It happens that I had a very strong debugging tool too close from myself and I hadn&rsquo;t used it.

Sadly, I realized that they are not comparable. To compare XML with JSON is just like compare an OpenOffice document with a text file. They are completely different things.
A JSON file is a set of grouped data. Nothing more.

      Lately I am seeing lots of comparatives between JSON and XML. I do not want to be less than them, so I investigated a little to enter in this kind of comparatives.
Sadly, I realized that they are not comparable. To compare XML with JSON is just like compare an OpenOffice document with a text file. They are completely different things.
A JSON file is a set of grouped data. Nothing more.
