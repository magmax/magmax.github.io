    <description><![CDATA[In this article I will talk about what Engineering means to me.
I&rsquo;d like to ask any reader that, before reading this article, use a couple of minutes to answer the question: &ldquo;What does &lsquo;to be an Engineer&rsquo; mean?&quot;. After this small exercise, I suggest to write a short answer down in a piece of paper.
After doing that, you can read the article. If it likes you or not, compare my answer with yours.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[This week I realized about the difference between an ugly constructor and a pretty one. It is curious how easy doing it well is and how cheap it is, so I am going to share my point with you, waiting your comments.

    <description><![CDATA[Today I have discovered lots of things about this great unknown assert.
It happens that I had a very strong debugging tool too close from myself and I hadn&rsquo;t used it.
Trying to fix this problem, I write this article, but I am not going to write anything that is not already written at Java Assert Documentation or Python Documentation.
  The more basic First step is to know how to use it.]]></description>
