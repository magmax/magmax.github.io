      <description>This post will document how to run an ArgoCD instance locally, using Kind to create the Kubernetes cluster. In addition, I will use cert-manager to create a self-signed certificate to serve it with HTTPS.
  Creating the cluster with kind First of all, is to have a Kubernetes cluster. You will require to have kind available in your path (maybe downloading to your ~/bin or ~/.local/bin makes the trick). This is the configuration file I used:</description>

      <description>After reading the article &amp;ldquo;Is Code Coverage Irrelevant?&amp;rdquo; by Ron Jeffries I feel the necessity to accept the challenge and tell what I really think about code coverage.
I&amp;rsquo;ve being thinking for some time about writting this article&amp;hellip; So this is the best moment, I think.
  What does the coverage means? Let&amp;rsquo;s start with this twit:
 Two projects, one has 95% code coverage with tests, one has 45%.</description>

      <description>Nowadays, SOA architectures is in fashion. These architectures use little and very specific services, so they interact each other.
In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll show how to use Celery in order to create a SOA architecture.
  About Celery Celery is not a communication system, because it uses RabbitMQ, Redis, etc. as communication system. The same applies to argue it is not a message queue system. Neither it is a protocol, because it uses AMQP.</description>

      <description>In this article I will talk about what Engineering means to me.
I&amp;rsquo;d like to ask any reader that, before reading this article, use a couple of minutes to answer the question: &amp;ldquo;What does &amp;lsquo;to be an Engineer&amp;rsquo; mean?&amp;quot;. After this small exercise, I suggest to write a short answer down in a piece of paper.
After doing that, you can read the article. If it likes you or not, compare my answer with yours.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m following the Software Security course at Coursera.
In this course, they explain how an adversary can take advantage of code defects and how to defend from them. I&amp;rsquo;ve looking for some like this for long time.
At the end of one of the videos there is a kind of poetry I liked. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t found it in Internet. So I&amp;rsquo;ve copied it here. It gathers all kind of code defects we should avoid because an adversary can try to use them.</description>

      <description>After writting the article Why Java rocks, I have no other option than writting why Python rocks.
Before starting, I might advise you that Python is my favourite language. And this is like search your best friends defects.
  Python Rocks Dynamic typing Opposite to people&amp;rsquo;s opinion, Python is strongly typed. But it is dynamically typed also. You cannot modify the type of a variable, but you can reuse the same variable to point to&amp;hellip; another thing.</description>

      <description>Some days ago I browsed a Kinisoftware slideshow and he said that &amp;ldquo;Java rules&amp;rdquo;. He couldn&amp;rsquo;t explain why Java rules at the end, so I decided to do it in his place.
But at the end I will explain why Java does not rule.
I hope that Kinisoftware can read this and criticate it with all his soul. Kini: This is for you!
  Java does rule Static typing The first thing you realize about Java is its static typing.</description>

      <description>This week I realized about the difference between an ugly constructor and a pretty one. It is curious how easy doing it well is and how cheap it is, so I am going to share my point with you, waiting your comments.
Since I began to work, I have done lots of ugly things, so do not face me up if you find something mine done in a different way :D The real goal is to improve yourself day after day!</description>

      <description>Today I have discovered lots of things about this great unknown assert.
It happens that I had a very strong debugging tool too close from myself and I hadn&amp;rsquo;t used it.
Trying to fix this problem, I write this article, but I am not going to write anything that is not already written at Java Assert Documentation or Python Documentation.
  The more basic First step is to know how to use it.</description>

      <title>XML vs JSON (en)</title>

      <description>Lately I am seeing lots of comparatives between JSON and XML. I do not want to be less than them, so I investigated a little to enter in this kind of comparatives.
Sadly, I realized that they are not comparable. To compare XML with JSON is just like compare an OpenOffice document with a text file. They are completely different things.
A JSON file is a set of grouped data. Nothing more.</description>

      <description>Some time ago, Manolowar showed me the operator [&amp;ldquo;Elvis] from Groovy .
  This operator, written like: ?: is called in this way because it looks like an emoticon with toupee, just like Elvis Presley. It can be used like in C or Java (separated) or all together. When it is all together, it means something like: &amp;ldquo;If value is false, assign me it, and if not, assign me this other one&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Moving my site I realized that I have&amp;rsquo;t wrote any post about Django. I was sure enough to have been done it. So I must solve this problem XD
  What is that? Django is a framework to build web applications. It is centered on the backend, offering you templates to use in the frontend, but it is possible that you need another additional framework for this layer, just like JQuery , Dojo , Mootools , Prototype , etc.</description>

      <description>I have just build my first Kohana module. It is a mess right now, but it is only a try that become to something. It is possible that I must to rewrite it completely.
You can get the code to test it , but it can be changed quickly and it can be not behind compatible.
This module allows to generate dinamically views for our model and controller.
  Steps to use it are next ones:</description>

I had been waiting for it for a long time. Lots of people join together all around the world to improve their skills as Developers.
I had the chance of attending the Madrid meeting. It was carried on by Enrique Comba. There I found a lot of people that I met first time in another Code Retreat, a year ago. I met new people too.
  My first thought was that I must not to be there.</description>

      <description>We are going to see how to use Netbeans templates, trying to stablish the license in spite of current header. It will be done in two easy steps.
  First steps. The first thing to do is to add the license we want. We open the menu: &amp;ldquo;Tool-&amp;gt;Templates&amp;rdquo;, opening the Template Manager. Only to see how is it, we can open the file &amp;ldquo;Java-&amp;gt;Java Class&amp;rdquo;. If it has not been edited, it is something like:</description>

      <description>I hate listenig things like &amp;ldquo;Madrid is much better than my town, because they organize a lot of things&amp;rdquo;.
This is a complete conceptual error. The problem is not that few things were organized in your town; the problem is that you are not organizing them.
  It is too easy complaining about other people who does nothing, but the first step is to focus on the things you do.</description>

  No one likes to sit at home and wait for their favorite show to come on anymore and many have turned to buying hardware to record them for later viewing. Popular solutions to this problem include the expensive and proprietary TiVo and cable/satellite boxes with built-in TV recorders.</description>

  Pressing the tab key in bash to auto-complete a file name is one of the most time saving tricks especially when dealing with very long file names. Unfortunately, file name completion is not always the right behavior. Take Subversion for example. The first argument to svn is the sub-command to use.</description>

  There are many command-line utilities in the Unix / Linux world that collect network traffic statistics for a chosen interface.
vnstat is different because statistics are collected permanently. It keeps the data in files so traffic monitoring is resumed at reboot. vnstat can be useful in situations when you need to know the exact amount of traffic that goes through the interface for a period longer than the computer is on.</description>

All of their articles were lost. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to recover as much as I can. They may be incomplete.

Fonty Python is available from the fontypython package in both Debian and Ubuntu in Universe. Fonty is a wxPython app so will work in any desktop environment. It also has a command-line interface which avoids the gui.
  What the font? As a graphic designer, one is called-upon to create artwork for many things.</description>
