      <description>After writting the article Why Java rocks, I have no other option than writting why Python rocks.
Before starting, I might advise you that Python is my favourite language. And this is like search your best friends defects.

      <description>Some days ago I browsed a Kinisoftware slideshow and he said that &amp;ldquo;Java rules&amp;rdquo;. He couldn&amp;rsquo;t explain why Java rules at the end, so I decided to do it in his place.
But at the end I will explain why Java does not rule.
I hope that Kinisoftware can read this and criticate it with all his soul. Kini: This is for you!
  Java does rule Static typing The first thing you realize about Java is its static typing.</description>
